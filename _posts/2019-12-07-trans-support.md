*By request, here's a public version of a toot I wrote as a reply to someone asking for encouragement. I hope this can help encourage you, too.*

It's natural to want to run away from scary things like transitioning. Even if it's difficult and scary right now, the urge to run away and give up or get rid of things (like feminine clothing, make-up, etc.) that you've obtained to help you feel better is a fight-or-flight response.

It sounds so much easier to give up, but from my experience...even if it hurts now, it'll hurt even more later if you do give up.

Think of how you want to see yourself in five years. Don't think about *right now* or what *could* happen during transition; think about the person you want to strive to be. How does it make you feel when you think about it? It may seem like a dream. It did for me.

When I started transition, I never thought I'd ever be able to look like anything other than a dude. I catastrophized about worst-case scenarios, fully believing that these bad things would 100% happen. I wanted to give up so badly because I didn't think I'd ever have a "successful" transition. But I didn't give up, even though it hurt so much. I couldn't bear the thought of things being the same as they were then in another five years.

I won't say that transitioning is easy. Mine was full of stumbles and hardship. I lost my entire "family" (blood relatives). Bad things did happen. But here I am, 6 years later, and I actually ended up closer to what I had wanted to become. I feel like myself. It's life-changing. It was difficult. But I wouldn't have become who I am today had I not gone through with it. I regret nothing. This is a glimpse of my story.

It's your decision to make. I want you to think about how you feel. Even if you decide not to transition, you are still valid. You are still trans. You are still one of us. And you will still have my support. <3
