I"<p>If you know me, you’re probably aware that I’m obsessed with <strong>Dance Gavin Dance</strong>; they are my most favorite band of all time. I believe that everything they’ve released (at least in the <em>Tilian</em> era) has been complete gold. They are absolutely brilliant.</p>

<p>Their new album, <em>Afterburner</em>, dropped on April 24th, 2020. I’m still absorbing this album, and I will be for a while. That being said, my initial reaction to the album was that I didn’t think it was as good as <em>Artificial Selection</em> or <em>Mothership</em>. Full disclaimer: I wasn’t completely thrilled with <em>Artificial Selection</em> when it first released, either, but now I absolutely adore it. It also spawned my absolute favorite song, <em>Son of Robot</em>. So I go into this fully expecting to fall in love with <em>Afterburner</em>.</p>

<p>I’m just going to give my thoughts on some of the lyrics featured in this album. In this post, I’ll cover a section of the song <em>Say Hi</em>.</p>

<h3 id="say-hi">“Say Hi”</h3>

<p>This song is the heaviest track on the album, and it’s absolutely wonderful. This song is full-on <strong>Secret Band</strong> with Tilian’s vocals perfectly integrated into the track. This is what DGD would sound like if they were Secret Band. Or if Secret Band were DGD. Or whatever. Anyway, I want to highlight these lyrics that were wonderfully performed by Jon Mess:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uh uh hi</p>

  <p>How do I say hi to another guy when I wanna die</p>

  <p>Why? Uh hi</p>

  <p>Why don’t you say hi, we’re all alive, I guess that’s nice, don’t wanna die</p>

  <p>Hi</p>

  <p>It’s nice to be alive, don’t wanna die, you should say hi, I won’t lie</p>

  <p>Hi</p>

  <p>But first I’m saying hi to say I tried to stay alive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without being familiar with Dance Gavin Dance or Jon Mess’s vocal style, you’d probably think these lyrics are just simple and nothing special. The fact of the matter is that Jon’s delivery of these lyrics is so intense and heavy-hitting; you can hear the despair in his screams.</p>

<p>DIsclaimer: The way I’m interpreting these lyrics is about how <em>I</em> get meaning out of them. So, this section of the song seems to convey the struggles of people with depression and inability to reach out. We are often too scared to say anything or to reach out to other people when we are in this state. It’s not from a lack of trying, or because we are lazy; it’s because it’s almost impossible for us to do this (“<em>How do I say hi to another guy when I wanna die</em>”). So why don’t other people reach out to us or just drop a line and say hi? (<em>“Why don’t you say hi”</em>). Well, in general, they won’t, so I guess the best thing to do would be to pretend that everything is fine, right? (<em>“We’re all alive, I guess that’s nice, don’t wanna die”)</em>. These lyrics are presented with some sarcasm; we’re saying it’s nice to be alive and that we don’t want to die, but that’s obviously not how we are actually feeling. We just think it’s how people want us to act, because otherwise, why would they even want to talk with us? But we would like for you to say hi or reach out to us. (<em>“It’s nice to be alive, don’t wanna die, you should say hi, I won’t lie”</em>). Finally, we get to a point where we are just so down and desperate that we take every last bit of energy we have just to say “hi” (or to reach out) to someone. (<em>“But first I’m saying hi to say I tried to stay alive”</em>).</p>

<p>I believe this is a commentary on how difficult it is for people struggling with depression (or mental illnesses in general) to actually reach out to people. We are lonely, we need companionship, we need someone who cares, someone who will listen to us and not just expect us to be all sunshine and rainbows all the time. It’s not the way this world works, though, what with people being like, “Depressed people are lazy af, I cured my depression by deciding to not to be depressed! It’s as simple as that!”</p>

<p>Not everyone can do this, but for me, personally, I do not hide the fact that I am mentally ill. There’s this huge stigma around mental illnesses (especially ones like Borderline Personality Disorder) and it is something that needs to go away.</p>

<p>Anyway, this was my take on this particular section of the song <em>Say Hi</em> by <strong>Dance Gavin Dance</strong> on their album <em>Afterburner</em>.</p>
